- Add a tcp socket to tcp_tasklet_func when ACKs arrive instead of
  immediately enqueuing  data?

- Bypassing qdisc when it is empty is probably important for
  performance, but if we are about to send data from multiple different
  sockets then bypassing qdisc is a bad idea:
	- Also, even if qdisc is not bypassed, it is then immediately
	  scheduled in the current Linux code? I should make some sort
	  of xmit_batch type flag to signal that multiple TCP sockets
	  are being serviced at the same time.

- Dynamically chose a sockets TCP byte limit depending on how it is
  being queued?

- Check if and/or get skb's from multiple sk's to be dequeued fairly in
  a batch from qdisc
